  This project contains the constantly updated data,
  analysis, and results of a sustainanle literature review
  on the state and evolution of empirical research in
  requirements engineering (RE) using the developed
  KG-EmpiRE.


  KG-EmpiRE is a community-maintainable knowledge graph (KG)
  of empirical research in requirements engineering based on
  scientific data extracted from currently 680 papers
  published in the research track of the IEEE International
  Conference on Requirement Engineering from 1994 to 2022.
  We are currently organizing scientific data in KG-EmpiRE
  using a defined template for the six themes of research
  paradigm, research design, research method, data
  collection, data analysis and bibliographic metadata with
  the long-term plan to expand the themes.


  KG-EmpiRE itself is maintained in the Open Research
  Knowledge Graph (ORKG). The ORKG is a cross-domain and
  cross-topic research knowledge graph (RKG) with a
  corresponding technical infrastructure and services for
  the organization of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,
  and Reusable (FAIR) scientific data from papers in
  accordance with the FAIR data principles. The TIB -
  Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology
  developes and maintains the ORKG permaently and has
  committed itself to the long-term archiving of all data.
  As a central accees point to all curated papers in
  KG-EmpiRE, we established a more general ORKG observatory
  on empirical research in software engineering. In
  addition, we add a RDF dump of the ORKG to each release of
  the project published on Zenodo, which includes the most
  recent analyzed data from KG-EmpiRE.


  In this project, we perform the data analysis of
  KG-EmpiRE, which has two purposes:

      1. We evaluate the coverage of the curated topic of empirical research in RE by KG-EmpiRE.

      2. We gain insights into the state and evolution of empirical research in RE.


  The data analysis is based on competency questions
  regarding empirical research in SE, including RE, derived
  from the vision of Sjøberg et al. (2007). Sjøberg et al.
  (2007) describe their vision of the role of empirical
  methods in SE, including RE, for the period of 2020 – 2025
  by comparing the "current" state of practice (2007) with
  their target state (2020 - 2025). We analyzed these
  descriptions and derived a total of 77 competency
  questions. The number of competency questions answered
  reflects the coverage of the curated topic in KG-EmpiRE
  (1), and the answers to competency questions provide
  insights into the state and evolution of empirical
  research in RE (2). For each competency question that can
  be answered with KG-EmpiRE (currently 16 of 77), we
  specified a SPARQL query to retrieve and analyze the data
  of KG-EmpiRE from the ORKG. We provide all details of the
  analysis with its SPARQL queries, data, visualizations,
  and explanations in the Jupyter Notebook hosted on
  mybinder for interactive reproduction and (re-)use, always
  using the most recent data from KG-EmpiRE.


  The analysis of the individual competency questions always
  follows the same structure:

    1. Data Selection: Explaining the competency question and the required data for the analysis.
    
    2. Data Collection: Executing the specified SPARQL query to retrieve the data.
    
    3. Data Exploration: Exploring the data, including its cleaning and validation, to prepare the data for data analysis.
    
    4. Data Analysis: Analyzing the data and creating visualizations.
    
    5. Data Interpretation: Interpreting the data and derive insights.


  Overall, this project serves to make the data, analysis,
  and results openly available in the long term according to
  the FAIR data principles to enable a reproducible,
  (re-)usable and thus sustainable literature review.

  In this way, this project can be used to:

      1. Reproduce the results from the Related Publication.

      2. (Re-)use KG-EmpiRE with its data for other research on empirical research in RE.

      3. Replicate our research approach for sustainable literature reviews on other topics.
